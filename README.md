# Cancer-Detection
Leukemia may be a white blood cell (WBC) malignancy that alters the structure of
bone marrow and blood. If not diagnosed at an early stage, the sickness may be fatal.
To manually identify the types of malignant illness cells, full blood count (CBC) or
morphological analysis are frequently used. These methods take time, and there are
fewer fixes that can be made. Using microscopic blood image analysis, they have
planned an automatic method for the detection of chronic scholastic leukemia (ALL),
acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML). This method first separates the different types of cells from
the image, such as platelets, red blood cells, and white blood cells. Afterward White
blood cells are divided from lymphocytes. The lymphocytes' form and color options
are then retrieved and provided to an SVM classifier, which divides the cells into
conventional and blast categories. The counting of WBC cells is then determined for a
precise diagnosis. In comparison to manual identification methods, an automated
technique for detecting malignant neoplastic disease was proven to be more useful,
quick, and accurate
